# Expo Navigation (Core) ðŸ¥³

This library provides the core API, types and mobile files for packages such as `expo-gatbsy-navigation` and `expo-next-react-navigation`.

It won't be used directly in projects, rather it provides the starting point for expo web navigation libraries.

**React Navigation v4 is no longer being maintained.**
